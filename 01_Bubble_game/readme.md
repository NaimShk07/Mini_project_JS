# Learnings

1. event bubbling = when put a event listner on a element and if it doesn't any event it check the parent element and then parent so on.

2. I had container ans inside 140 bubble element
i put event to the container and click on element and get the element with delts.target

3. make small part of code put in function

4. there are two  ways to put event on multiple element which one is clicked tell me,  1 is puttin event on parent element and acces in by delt.target or 2 store all the element into one variable and run foreach loop an add event into all.

## Extra
